- 👋 Hi, I’m @AhmedRed
- 👀 I’m interested in writing performant backend applications and seeing them solve problems in real time.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with kotlin/java, ktor/spring, graphql and gcp using terraform/helm.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend for enterprise systems and relevant open-source plugins.
